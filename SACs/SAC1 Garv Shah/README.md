# SAC 1 - Garv Shah

The following folder contains code and tests for my first SAC. It consists of 4 sections:

1. Module 1 - Word Match
2. Module 2 - Primary School Word Quiz
3. Module 3 - Gui
4. Module 4 - Short Answer Questions

## Note:

I ended up creating a blog for the subject where different versions of these rendered test tables are available, so
although these are the originals, the more *up to date*, better looking versions are available at my
blog [here](https://garv-shah.github.io/software-dev-blog/).

## Module 1 - Word Match

This module is a program that selects a random alphabet and position, and then gets all five-letter words from a csv
file that match the alphabet and position. It's relatively simple, and the code can be found in `./Word Match/main.py`.
<br> The test table can be found
[here](https://garv-shah.github.io/software-dev/SACs/SAC1%20Garv%20Shah/Word%20Match/testing).

## Module 2 - Primary School Word Quiz

This module is a terminal-based quiz that reads from a csv file to ask the user a few questions. I mainly spent my time
validating the csv file and adding in various errors and information about where the error occurred. The code can be
found in `./Primary School Word Quiz/main.py`. <br> The test table can be
found [here](https://garv-shah.github.io/software-dev/SACs/SAC1%20Garv%20Shah/Primary%20School%20Word%20Quiz/testing).

## Module 3 - CGS Juice Bar

This module was a GUI food ordering system, specifically for various types of juices at a theoretical shop. There were
various requirements, such as only being able to select a max of 4 fruits/vegetables, as well as categories with prices.
The code can be found in `./CGS Juice Bar/main.py`. <br> The test table can be
found [here](https://garv-shah.github.io/software-dev/SACs/SAC1%20Garv%20Shah/CGS%20Juice%20Bar/testing).

## Module 4 - Short Answer Test

This final module was a written test, on a word doc. We had to answer various questions about programming conventions, features and explain some logic. It was quite simpe, but a good opportunity to demonstrate understand. You can view the word document online [here](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://github.com/garv-shah/software-dev/blob/main/SACs/SAC1%20Garv%20Shah/2022_SD_SAC1_module4_test%20V2.docx?raw=true) to see what I did :D
