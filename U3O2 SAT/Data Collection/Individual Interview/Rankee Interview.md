# Rankee Interview

1. What’s your name/details?
    
    Rankee Jin Year 12 Wilsmore
    
2. What works with the current system?
    
    People can access different questions and check their solutions
    
3. What doesn’t work with the current system?
    
    The leaderboard and quiz functions don't work ~~(get directed to some random YouTube videos lol)~~
    
4. What would make the system easier to use?
    
    Can be divided into different sections (eg senior section and junior section). A dropdown list can be created at the very top that can direct us to the specific problems instead of scrolling over a long list to find them.
    
5. What new features would you like to see in my implementation?
    
    Same as Benson ig... we can allow them to submit the answer online, and can also make use of the leaderboard feature to award points to whoever submit the problems and got them right. The less time they take to finish the question the more points they get. (Also, I'd suggest not showing them the answers until they finish the question... ~~or if they really want to see the answer they have to pay a number of points :P~~) If possible we can create a multiplayer mode where different people can compete against each other to answer the questions. Additionally, a dashboard can be set up for each user that lists the questions he/she completed and the time & date he/she completed these, as well as his/her ranking
    
6. Do you want the app to be restricted to CGS students, or should it be open for anyone?
    
    I don't really mind if it is open for everyone... If possible we can create a school ranking and a worldwide ranking ~~(like what Education Perfect did)~~
    
7. Are there any specific design elements you would like to see?
    
    I think our current design is good enough, maybe we can add some geometric shapes or elements in that app (simplistic designs would be good enough)
    
8. What platforms would you like the app to be on, in order of preference?
    
    iOS, Android, (maybe more)
    
9. Should you be able to chat/message other people on the app?
    
    A community section where forums and chatboxes are available for people to discuss the problems can be included
