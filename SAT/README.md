This SAT covers a majority of Software Development as a subject, and for this project, I have chosen to develop an app
for my school Maths Club.
Below is a directory of my work, organised by each outcome/section :D

# SAT Preparations (pre-outcomes)

- [SAT Ideas](U3O2%20SAT/SAT%20Preperations/SAT%20Ideas.md)
- [Software Solution Questions](U3O2%20SAT/SAT%20Preperations/Software%20Solution%20Questions.md)

# [U3O2](U3O2%20SAT)

## Project Plans (U3O2, 1)

For the project plans, I developed and maintained my project plans using Quire, where a link to the timeline can be
found [here](https://quire.io/w/Garv_SAT?view=timeline).

Unfortunately, Quire does provide ease of use, but doesn't provide the ability to add comprehensive milestones and
dependencies, so I developed some software to convert between the two, which can be
found [here](../AOS2%20Programming/Code/Term%202/Weeks%201%20and%202/quire-to-excel).

This allowed me to develop project plans in the form of Gantt Charts found in the Project Planning folder. I did have to
make quite a few changes to the plan, switching from Waterfall to Agile and such, which can be found in the comparison
between [old](U3O2%20SAT/Project%20Plans/SAT%20Gantt%20Chart%20(old).xlsx) and [new](U3O2%20SAT/Project%20Plans/SAT%20Task%20List.xlsx), but
that's documented more later on.

- [SAT Task List](U3O2%20SAT/Project%20Plans/SAT%20Task%20List.xlsx)
- [Project Timeline for PSM](https://quire.io/w/Garv_SAT?view=timeline)
  Prepares Gantt Chart using software that:
    - [x] Comprehensively documents all stages of the PSM
    - [x] Comprehensively documents all activities of the PSM
    - [x] Does both for U3O2 and U4O1
- [Gantt Chart](U3O2%20SAT/Project%20Plans/SAT%20Task%20List.xlsx):
  Documents comprehensively all relevant:
    - [x] Tasks
    - [x] Sequencing
    - [x] Time Allocations
    - [x] Milestones
    - [x] Dependencies
    - [x] Critical Path

## Development Model (U3O2, 2)

- [Documentation of Agile](U3O2%20SAT/Project%20Plans/Development%20Model.md#agile)
    - [x] Comprehensively documents all features of selected development model
- [Justification](U3O2%20SAT/Project%20Plans/Development%20Model.md#selected-model)
    - [x] Comprehensively documents justification for selected development model

## Data Collection (U3O2, 3)

- [Data Collection](U3O2%20SAT/Data%20Collection/Data%20Collection.md)
- [Research](U3O2%20SAT/Data%20Collection/Research.md)
    - [x] Documents comprehensive set of relevant data for analysis using a wide range of data collection techniques

## Software Requirements Specification (U3O2, 3/4)

My SRS document can be found as a formalised PDF [here](U3O2%20SAT/SRS/Maths%20Club%20SRS.pdf)

- [x] Accurately uses all features of the selected analytical tools (SRS, DFD, Context Diagrams, etc)
- [x] Accurately depicts relationships between data, users, and digital systems in said tools
- [x] Comprehensively documents all functional and non-functional requirements
- [x] Comprehensively documents the technical environment and intended audience
- [x] Comprehensively documents evidence of critical thinking via the analysis of data ~~to determine reliability~~ (Ms.
  Cotugno said that the reliability part of it wasn't relevant, so I should ignore that)

## Software Design (U3O2, 5)

- [Mindmap & Sketches](U3O2%20SAT/Design%20Folio/Design.md#mindmap--sketches)
    - [x] Generates two distinctive & feasible original designs
- [Evaluation Criteria](U3O2%20SAT/Design%20Folio/Design.md#evaluation-criteria)
    - [x] Generates comprehensive evaluation criteria
- [Selected Design](U3O2%20SAT/Design%20Folio/Design.md#selected-design)
    - [x] Produces and justifies selected design, referencing evaluation criteria
- [Database Design](U3O2%20SAT/Design%20Folio/Database%20Design.md)
    - [x] Comprehensively documents evidence of critical/creative thinking through the connection + generation of ideas

# [U4O1](U4O1%20SAT)
