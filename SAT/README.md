This SAT covers Garv Shah's project for Software Development, where an app for the CGS Maths Club has been developed.
Below is a directory of work, organised by each outcome/section:

# SAT Preparations (pre-outcomes)

- [SAT Ideas](U3O2%20SAT/SAT%20Preperations/SAT%20Ideas.md)
- [Software Solution Questions](U3O2%20SAT/SAT%20Preperations/Software%20Solution%20Questions.md)

# [U3O2](U3O2%20SAT)

## Project Plans (U3O2, 1)

The project plans have been developed and maintained using Quire, where a link to the timeline can be
found [here](https://quire.io/w/Garv_SAT?view=timeline).

Unfortunately, Quire does provide ease of use, but doesn't provide the ability to add comprehensive milestones and
dependencies, so some software was developed to convert between the two, which can be
found [here](../AOS2%20Programming/Code/Term%202/Weeks%201%20and%202/quire-to-excel).

This allowed for the project plan to be developed in the form of the Gantt Charts found in the Project Planning folder.
Numerous changes had to be made to the timeline throughout planning, switching from Waterfall to Agile and such, which
can
be found in the comparison
between [old](U3O2%20SAT/Project%20Plans/SAT%20Gantt%20Chart%20(old).xlsx)
and [new](U3O2%20SAT/Project%20Plans/SAT%20Gantt%20Chart.xlsx). This is documented further in the process.
