# A Complete App!

The progress throughout this sprint was great. Essentially all of the app is complete, within my newly restricted scope.
This means that the whole app, with all of the core features are done, but the extras such as commenting on posts, the
badge system, and a button to scroll to your position on the leaderboards has all been left out of the sprint. It's
quite self-explanatory why these are extras, as they were put into my functional *requirements*, but they really
shouldn't have been required for a completed solution.

The progress during this sprint was quite smooth, namely in the second half when I had focused on what I specifically
wanted to do and stopped getting sidetracked. There were times during the sprint where I had encountered a problem, and
it wasn't necessary to fix it, but I became obsessed with the problem in of itself. I found that for projects like
these, it can be better to only focus on problems directly within the scope, and move others found through the
development process that are lower priority to a later sprint. This was especially true for when I wanted to make the
whole app stateful with a live stream. I thought it would be cool to have the whole app be live, but when I started
encountering problems with it, I should have realised that it was not worth pursuing and just moved it to something that
could be done at a later date. Instead, I got way too fixated on it, and tried to create a custom implementation, which I
had to scrap later due to the problems I encountered with it anyway. It was a major roadblock and took up far more time
than it should have, taking away from more important features.

Either way, this sprint was extremely productive, and I'm proud of the finished app. I'll be continuing onto the testing
phase, but may add some of the desired features as well if I find the time.
