1. **What is meant by a software solution?**

   A software solution is a program that helps perform time consuming tasks or automate regular tasks to make a certain action for an end user easier. As such, it is custom-built to solve a specific problem experienced by a client.

2. **Why are software requirements specifications (SRS) written?**

   An SRS creates an extremely in-depth description of the software that’s going to be developed, and outlines how almost every way it works, such as the constraints, the scope and the overall requirements of the system itself. They are written because they provide a very good way to plan for a solution, and provide a single source of truth for you or a whole team to look at. It keeps you on track, and creates the framework for making a larger solution, being very much important in larger teams.

3. **Identify two consequences of a badly managed project?**

   A badly managed project will have a lot of bugs in the future, which could have easily been avoided if the project was better managed. This, in a real world situation, could result in a lot of money lost in the long run, with damages, worse reputation, delays and a lack of sustainability in progress. As well as this, another consequence is that it is *much*  harder for other people to work on a badly managed project, as the code becomes a spaghetti mess that no one can read and it becomes a puzzle to decipher. To be able to work with other people, you need to be able to manage your project well.

4. **Why is a Gantt Chart used?**

   Such a scheduler helps teams work well together and allocate resources properly so that deadlines can be met. Similarly, if you are working by yourself, setting smaller deadlines like this helps a lot when trying to push yourself to actually work on a project, because they can seem so incredibly big that splitting it up into smaller deadlines is very useful. This aid in time management is very similar to the reason that people set goals in the first place: to motivate them to do work in a timely fashion.

5. **When would an observation be a preferred method of collecting data?**
   Observation would be the preferred method of collecting data when you want to avoid errors and varying results as a result of bias during the process. This could be because of the test conditions, or the large amount of control variables not being able to be met, but whatever it is, sometimes it is just too hard to simulate real world usage in a controlled environment, because real end-users do wacky stuff that you couldn’t have predicted. As such, it is nice to have a group of testers that know they are being observed, using that observation data to improve the product, and then putting it into the wild to gain more holistic data in a release candidate.

6. **How does a survey different from an interview?**

   Surveys can be done on a much larger group of people and are more accessible to gain information from a larger sample group. At the same time, the information is normally of a lower quality, not necessarily being accurate all of the time and maybe being rushed. Interviews on the other hand are a lot less accessible and happen with fewer people, but are more in depth and gain more quality information, normally by asking certain individuals questions and recording their verbal responses. They normally have a higher response rate, with people actually wanting to properly answer the questions in them

7. **What is meant by the term 'robustness' and what can be done to make a solution robust?**

   Robustness is the concept of how easily a system is able to cope with errors that it was not expecting to receive. This is namely with receiving invalid inputs, and how well the system can handle invalid inputs from users without failing or having an unexpected result. The way to make a system or solution more robust is by utilising a testing method called fault injection, where you purposely feed your program with invalid data to see how well it handles it. By handling each of these cases, robustness can be improved.

8. **What is the different between robustness and reliability?**

   Robustness is how well a system works when it is given invalid inputs, whereas reliability is how well the system works under the expected circumstances, into the future. As such, a reliable system should work all the time, with little downtime, but robust systems should work when given an unexpected scenario, being able to handle it anyways.

9. **What are the four components of an information system?**

   Hardware, software, network communication and data.

10. **Categorise each of these requirements as functional or non-functional:**
     1. A report must print to a printer (functional)
     2. All font colours must be green (non-functional)
     3. A discount must be applied to a product (functional)
     4. The drone must be able to navigate a path through a maze (functional)
     5. The body mass index of a person will be calculated (functional)
     6. typical six-year old should understand all of the words displayed (non-functional)
     7. Button sizes must be big enough for touch-screen capability (non-functional)
     8. Input can be via voice or keyboard (non-functional)
