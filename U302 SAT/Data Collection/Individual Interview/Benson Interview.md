2. What works with the current system?
    
    all the problems can be accessed by everyone

    leaderboard, take quiz functions doesnt work
    
4. What would make the system easier to use?
    
    1 suggestion is to have a calendar sort of thing, by selecting into a specific week the questions for that week will come up. This is better than simply have all problems listed in order, cuz as the number of weeks gets bigger its harder to get to earlier problems

    the ability to submit answer online, and the website will tell u whether the answer is correct or not.
