# The following is useful in implementing computer players in a number of different games. Write a program that
# creates a 5 Ã— 5 list consisting of zeroes and ones. Your program should then pick a random location in the list
# that contains a zero and change it to a one. If all the entries are one, the program should say so. [Hint: one way
# to do this is to create a new list whose items are the coordinates of all the ones in the list and use the choice
# method to randomly select one. Use a two-element list to represent a set of coordinates.]
