# Write a program that allows the user to enter five numbers (read as strings). Create a string that consists of the
# userâ€™s numbers separated by plus signs. For instance, if the user enters 2, 5, 11, 33, and 55, then the string
# should be '2+5+11+33+55'.

for i in range(5):
    numbers.append(input(f'{i + 1}. Enter a number: '))
