This SAT covers a majority of Software Development as a subject, and for this project, I have chosen to develop an app for my school Maths Club. 
Below is a directory of my work, organised by each outcome/section :D

# SAT Preperations (pre-outcomes)
- [SAT Ideas](SAT%20Preperations/SAT%20Ideas.md)
- [Software Solution Questions](SAT%20Preperations/Software%20Solution%20Questions.md)

# Project Plans (Unit 3 Outcome 2, 1)
For the project plans, I developed and maintained my project plans using Quire, where a link to the timeline can be found [here](https://quire.io/w/Garv_SAT?view=timeline).

Unfortunately, Quire does provide ease of use, but doesn't provide the ability to add comprehensive milestones and dependencies, so I developed some software to convert between the two, which can be found [here](../AOS2%20Programming/Code/Term%202/Weeks%201%20and%202/quire-to-excel).

This allowed me to develop project plans in the form of Gantt Charts found in the Project Planning folder. I did have to make quite a few changes to the plan, switching from Waterfall to Agile and such, which can be found in the comparison between [old](Project%20Plans/SAT%20Gantt%20Chart%20(old).xlsx) and [new](Project%20Plans/SAT%20Task%20List.xlsx), but that's documented more later on.

- [SAT Task List](Project%20Plans/SAT%20Task%20List.xlsx)
- [Project Timeline for PSM](https://quire.io/w/Garv_SAT?view=timeline)
  Prepares Gantt Chart using software that:
  - [x] Comprehensively documents all stages of the PSM
  - [x] Comprehensively documents all activities of the PSM
  - [x] Does both for U3O2 and U4O1
- [Gantt Chart](Project%20Plans/SAT%20Task%20List.xlsx):
  Documents comprehensively all relevant:
  - [x] Tasks
  - [x] Sequencing
  - [x] Time Allocations
  - [x] Milestones
  - [x] Dependencies
  - [x] Critical Path
