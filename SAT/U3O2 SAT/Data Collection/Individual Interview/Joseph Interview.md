# Joseph Interview

1. What’s your name/details?
    
    Joseph Hartono
    
2. What works with the current system?
    
    The tabs for the solution, the problems up in a logical sequential manner (week by week, in order)
    
    The sourcing is good
    
    Aesthetics is *okay*, but it’s not the *best*
    
3. What doesn’t work with the current system?
    
    Uploading is difficult
    
    Simple, not necessarily a bad thing
    
4. What would make the system easier to use?
    
    Having some sort of GUI to upload problems, images, text, whatever
    
    LATEX isn’t too bad, but HTML and manual coding and setup is quite annoying
    
    Some sort of system that automatically does the posting for you, some sort of admin view, some interface to upload/manage posts/users
    
5. What new features would you like to see in my implementation?
    
    Maybe a quiz function, but that does feel like an add-on and the essence of the app is simple
    
    Leaderboards isn’t a bad idea, concerned about how much more work it would be about questions appropriate for everyone’s level, balancing the different skill levels, making it winnable for everyone despite skill level
    
    Wants the system to be fair, no matter what
    
    Could have notifications for each new post, all these features are little bonuses
    
6. Do you want the app to be restricted to CGS students, or should it be open for anyone?
    
    Should be fine if the general public has access to it, only drawback can be seen is privacy issues, but that shouldn’t be *too* bad
    
7. Are there any specific design elements you would like to see?
    
    Not that they can think of
    
8. What platforms would you like the app to be on, in order of preference?
    - Website
    - iOS
    - Android
    - MacOS
    - Windows
    - Linux
9. Should you be able to chat/message other people on the app?
    
    Maybe not message, but comment on posts
    
    Might deter from the actual app, comments on post promote discussion
    
10. Issues you may think of
    
    CGS students interacting with strangers may be an issue
    
    Possible solution is having approved users, anyone can read it but you have to be approved to send messages
