I did a survey!!

For my data collection phase, I interviewed the Maths Club team individually, which you can see below. Along
with this, I sent out a survey to the students who frequently attend Maths Club to gather their opinions, which can be
seen in the link below too.

- [Interviews](Interviews.md)

- [https://gshah6110.typeform.com/report/OsdmyTYx/E4N1MNmyp1szPoVb](https://gshah6110.typeform.com/report/OsdmyTYx/E4N1MNmyp1szPoVb)

The main takeaways from the survey would be the features that the clients want, a few that I did not previously think
of, such as a search function for the posts. Some of the answers weren’t too surprising, such as the preferred
platforms:

### Which of these platforms would you like to see, in order of preference?

1. Website (#1.8 average)
2. MacOS (#2.2 average)
3. iOS/iPadOS (#2.4 average)
4. Android (#3.8 average)
5. Windows (#4.8 average)
6. Linux (#6 average)
7. WatchOS (#7 average)

On the other hand, some other stats were a bit more surprising, such as how almost half of the people that responded
actually preferred completely doing the questions by hand on paper. This means that even though a majority would prefer
to answer the questions online while working on paper, some people don’t like the device element, so simplicity should
be a focus, as if it’s too unnecessarily complicated for a target audience that doesn’t even want it, it won’t be an
effective solution.

Here’s a pros and cons table of each of the features possibly requested or discussed:

| Idea                                                                            | Pros                                                                                                                           | Cons                                                                                                                                                                        |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A search function to be able to look for specific posts, questions and sections | Makes the system more usable and easy to find what you’re looking for, can search for specific questions people are discussing | May take some time to implement, and may make the UI more complex. This being said, pros probably outweigh cons                                                             |
| Quiz System/Ability to Answer Online                                            | Makes it so you can answer questions anywhere, creates a record and a sense of achievement                                     | May be a bit more difficult and requires people to bring their devices, and about 40% of the responders said they fully preferred answering questions on paper              |
| Divided Sections for Junior/Senior/Term                                         | Good organisation, makes the app easier to navigate                                                                            | May create a bit of a divide amongst the students and prevent good discussions                                                                                              |
| Leaderboards/Competitions                                                       | Creates a sense of competition and uses gamification to make the club more fun and rewarding                                   | It might be hard to keep everything fair, like if someone was to view the answer beforehand, it might create a sense of false achievement and detract from the actual maths |
| Notifications for Posts                                                         | People know that maths club is running and they get notified!                                                                  | It may be a little annoying, so it should probably be optional                                                                                                              |
| Hints for Solutions                                                             | It provides a guide and a pathway that is more gratifying than just the solution                                               | It may be a bit more effort to create hints and makes the usability on our end a bit worse                                                                                  |
| Being able to message users                                                     | You get to ask people for help and interact with the community                                                                 | Could be a privacy concern with being a school app, and is probably a bit overboard                                                                                         |
| Forums/Ability to Comment on Posts                                              | Probably a better version of the above, allows community interaction while being less overboard                                | Could also be a privacy concern, but is easier to moderate (or only allow “verified” users to comment)                                                                      |

## Summary

In summary, this data collection phase has been a good starting point to understand what the target audience wants in
the app, which features would be more useful and which would not. Surprisingly, a lot of people really like the paper
part of maths, so though we want to reduce paper usage, we’ll have to keep the app simple so it just serves as a
repository of questions along with a place to keep record of what you’ve answered before. There’s about a 50% average
for how much people use the website currently, so as of now it’s not the *most* effective solution, namely because paper
can be more convenient, but hopefully this app can change that, and it seems *most* people agree, that it could be quite
useful. With the current system, people like the simplicity, how quick it loads and how easy it is to access, but there
are a few concerns such as ease of use on our end, being able to search for questions and an online record that people
would like to see. Namely, the ability to comment on posts and a quiz system both ranked pretty highly in features
people would like to see, followed by most of the features listed above. Messaging users probably won’t be seen in the
app as it’s just a bit too much. As for platforms, the website, MacOS and iOS will probably be the priority, as they are
the main ones that people seem to be using. Overall, this data should be a great starting point for the scope and SRS of
the project!

# Appendix (Reliability):

Through my collection of data, I was able to find various sources giving me a wide insight on the effectiveness and
performance of a variety of software solutions. For reliability, data was collected from a sufficiently large sample
size from both stakeholders, those who consume the content and those who produce the content. Getting information from a
variety of age groups, both from the Junior and Senior school has proved beneficial, as it is clear that different
demographics within the target audience have different priorities. This can be shown by the varying information supplied
in the interviews, along with the surveys, along with the secondary data collected from [internet research](Research.md). All in all,
it is safe to conclude that the data collected is sufficiently reliable, as it corroborates multiple sources, both
primary and secondary with varying demographics, sample sizes and priorities. If the variation and confirmation from
these multiple sources can be continually maintained, sources should remain of an acceptable reliability going into the
future as well.
