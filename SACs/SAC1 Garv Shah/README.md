# SAC 1 - Garv Shah

The following folder contains code and tests for my first SAC. It consists of 4 sections:

1. Module 1 - Word Match
2. Module 2 - Primary School Word Quiz
3. Module 3 - Gui
4. Module 4 - Short Answer Questions

## Module 1 - Word Match

This module is a program that selects a random alphabet and position, and then gets all five-letter words from a csv
file that match the alphabet and position. It's relatively simple, and the code can be found in `./Word Match/main.py`.

[here](https://garv-shah.github.io/software-dev/SACs/SAC1%20Garv%20Shah/Word%20Match/testing).

## Module 2 - Primary School Word Quiz

This module is a terminal-based quiz that reads from a csv file to ask the user a few questions. I mainly spent my time
validating the csv file and adding in various errors and information about where the error occurred. The code can be
found in `./Primary School Word Quiz/main.py`. <br> The test table can be
found [here](https://garv-shah.github.io/software-dev/SACs/SAC1%20Garv%20Shah/Primary%20School%20Word%20Quiz/testing).
