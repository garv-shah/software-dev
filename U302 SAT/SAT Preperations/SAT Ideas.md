# Idea 1:

## **Name of solution:**

App for Maths Club

## **General description of solution, which includes your target audience:**

The app would be a solution for the CGS Maths club that allows for an archive of posts and problems which students can
comment on, collaborate on and discuss with each other.

## **Programming language that you are planning to use to create your solution:**

Dart with the Flutter Framework

## **What are some of the specific features of your solution?**

I would like the solution to be very easy to use from a creator standpoint. We have a website as of now, which doesnâ€™t
work too well namely due to the fact that the creator tooling means that only I can make posts. I would like to make
this a lot nicer, along with quizzes which then turn into posts after a set amount of time, and if a quiz is completed
during the set period you are awarded points, allowing for a leaderboard. People should also be able to comment on
posts, or even message each other to ask questions.

## **What are some of the difficulties that you may encounter when it comes to programming your solution?**

I think creating nice tooling to not only be able to answer a question but also to create it will be quite difficult.
For example, $3x+6$ is the same as $3(x+2)$, but they look completely different on paper. This means that the computer
should be able to identify equations that are the same, but also creating a keyboard and a nice experience for this
might not be the nicest. I was considering using notion for actually creating the post, but that may not give me the
flexibility I want.
